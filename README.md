MOAT IoT Application Example
===
This is an example application using MOAT IoT API set.

The application is composed of 4 parts:

 1. An Android project using [MOAT Java](http://dev.yourinventit.com/references/moat-java-api-document)
 2. Server side Javascripts using [MOAT js](http://dev.yourinventit.com/references/moat-js-api-document)
 3. Rails application using [MOAT REST](http://dev.yourinventit.com/references/moat-rest-api-document)
 4. Google App Engine application using [MOAT REST](http://dev.yourinventit.com/references/moat-rest-api-document)

For users who aren't familiar with Rails or are using Windows OS, please choose Google App Engine application.

You need to sign up Inventit IoT Developer Network Sandbox Server in order to deploy the application.

(The server runtime environment will be available when [IIDN Command Line Tool](https://github.com/inventit/iidn-cli) is rolled out.)

## Get Started

See [the tutorial](http://dev.yourinventit.com/guides/get-started) to learn more.

## Setup Helper

As of 1.0.8, a setup helper script is included, which helps you to prepare building environment.

After signing up to IIDN, on the root of this project (same as where this README.md is) enter:

    moat-iot-get-started:$ rake

After a couple of minutes, the script will be terminated. And you need to run a few commands regarding signing secure token. The detailed commands are shown on the script log message. You can copy and paste the commands to run.
