MOAT IoT Application Example
===
This is an example application using MOAT IoT API set.

The application is composed of 3 parts:

 1. An Android project using [MOAT Java](http://dev.yourinventit.com/references/moat-java-api-document)
 2. Server side Javascripts using [MOAT js](http://dev.yourinventit.com/references/moat-js-api-document)
 3. Rails application using [MOAT REST](http://dev.yourinventit.com/references/moat-rest-api-document)

You need to sign up Inventit IoT Developer Network Sandbox Server in order to deploy the application.

(The server runtime environment will be available when [IIDN Command Line Tool](https://github.com/inventit/iidn-cli) is rolled out.)
